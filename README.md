# 2024-APS-URSI-3323


Repository hosting data and select machine learning examples from the paper "Machine Learning Assisted Hyperparameter Tuning for Optimization" presented in  IEEE AP-S 2024 in Florence, Italy, July 14-19, 2024.

Redirected from [PSO_datacollection](https://github.com/LC-Linkous/PSO_datacollection) to include updates and differentiate between conference presentations.

## Requirements

* The main example is designed to run in Google Colab with Jupyter Notebook. You must have a Google account to run these as-is. The Jupyter Notebook file(s) in this repository run individually. Library requirements for each tutorial and example may vary. Refer to a tutorial or example for the specific requirements.

* Linked repositories featuring optimizers have their own requirements, and will require a Python environment.


## How to Use
* To run, you will need to create a folder in your Google Drive, and add the dataset and all tutorials into the same folder.
* The optimizer repositories were designed to run locally in an IDE. As such, they will not run in Jupyter Notebook as-is and some modification is needed.
